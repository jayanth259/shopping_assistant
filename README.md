Title: Personalized Virtual Shopping Assistant on WhatsApp Using Llama Stack

Description: Develop an intelligent virtual assistant for retail that dynamically recommends
products, answers queries, and provides personalized shopping experiences using generative
AI. The model can adapt to customer behavior in real-time for better satisfaction.

Overview: This project involves the creation of a highly personalized virtual shopping assistant that
integrates with WhatsApp and leverages the Llama stack (a robust ecosystem of
LLaMA-based large language models). The assistant provides product recommendations,
answers customer queries, and enhances the shopping experience through interactive and
real-time conversations on WhatsApp. By analyzing user behavior, preferences, and browsing
history, the model adapts to customer behavior dynamically to maximize satisfaction and
sales outcomes.

Problem Statement: With the increasing popularity of conversational commerce, customers demand personalized
and seamless shopping experiences on platforms they use daily. WhatsApp, as a widely
adopted messaging app, is an ideal medium for real-time customer interactions. However,
existing solutions lack adaptability and fail to offer intelligent recommendations tailored to
individual user needs. This project aims to fill this gap by combining the power of WhatsApp
with the Llama stack for a real-time, personalized virtual shopping assistant.
